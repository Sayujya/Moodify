### What is this?
It's just lipstick over some APIs and some hacky stuff so that I can:  
1. I can ask Google Assistant to set the color of my lights to match the album art of the song that playing from Spotify on my living room chromecast
2. And do so without me having to pay money for servers and what not

### Why though?
I dunno. This was written over two nights so don't judge it too hard please. :)
